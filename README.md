README DESCRIBING HOW TO USE PROJECT:
To use this program, the user would simply watch the traffic until they saw one of the four identified types of vehicles:
truck, SUV, hybrid, or bicycle. Once they saw one of these four vehicles, they would click the add Click button however
many times correlates with that particular vehicle. For example, an SUV requires 2 clicks. After the add Click button
has been clicked the required number of times, the use would then go to their desired vehicle button and click that one
as well. If done correctly, the user should see a pop-up that notifies them they have added that particular vehicle. If
something was done incorrectly, the user will be notified they added an insufficient number of clicks. In this case, the
user would simply need to add the required additional clicks then click the desired vehicle button again. The user can
also see on the right side of the vehicle button how many of that particular vehicle can be expected to be see on any given
day to compare their data collection with what is typically seen. I designed this code to be as user-friendly as possible
so if any problems arise the directions to correct them are easy and direct.
